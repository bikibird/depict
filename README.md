# Depict
Depict is an image demake tool for PICO-8 that runs in your browser.  Load any image and create a dithered image that uses PICO-8 standard colors and is reduced to a maximum width and height of 128 x 128. Depict supports Ordered, Atkinson, Floyd-Steinberg, and Sierra2 dithering as well as some fun artistic dithers: rivers, streets, rain, and wind. Try it online: https://bikibird.itch.io/depict
