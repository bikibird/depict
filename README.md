# Depict
Depict is an image demake tool for PICO-8 that runs in your browser.  Load any image and create a dithered image that uses PICO-8 standard colors and is reduced to a maximum width and height of 128 x 128.  Ordered, Atkinson, Floyd-Steinberg, and Sierra2 dithering are supported.  Drag and drop the final result into the PICO-8 sprite sheet. Try it online here: https://bikibird.itch.io/depict
